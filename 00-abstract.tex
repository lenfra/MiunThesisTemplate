\section*{Abstract}\label{sec:abstract}
The report shall include two abstracts, one in Swedish and one in English. The abstract acts as a
description of the reportâ€™s contents. This allows for the possibility to have a quick review of the
report and provides an overview of the whole report, i.e.\ contains everything from the objectives
and methods to the results and conclusions. Examples: ``The objective of this study has been to
answer the question\dots. The study has been conducted with the aid of\dots. The study has shown
that\dots'' Do not mention anything that is not covered in the report. An abstract is written as one
piece and the recommended length is 200-250 words. References to the report's text, sources or
appendices are not allowed; the abstract should ``stand on its own''. Only use plain text, with no
characters in italic or boldface, and no mathematical formulas. The abstract can be completed by the
inclusion of keywords; this can ease the search for the report in the library databases. The
keywords should be listed in order of importance.
