\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}
The abstract acts as a description of the reports contents. This allows for the
possibility to have a quick review of the report and provides an overview of the
whole report, i.e.\ contains everything from the objectives and methods to the
results and conclusions. Examples: “The objective of this study has been to
answer the question…. The study has been conducted with the aid of…. The study
has shown that…” Do not mention anything that is not covered in the report. An
abstract is written as one piece and the recommended length is 200 --- 250 words.
References to the report's text, sources or appendices are not allowed; the
abstract should “stand on its own”. Only use plain text, with no characters in
italic or boldface, and no mathematical formulas. The abstract can be completed
by the inclusion of keywords; this can ease the search for the report in the
library databases.
