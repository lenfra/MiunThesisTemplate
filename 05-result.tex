\section{Result}\label{sec:result}
The results chapter is included when you have produced a systematic study, 
i.e.\ an evaluation of a program that you have developed, which is required for
C- and AV-level diploma work. In the results chapter objective results of the
empirical study are presented. Keep in mind that possible comments in this
chapter should only be used for clarification. Your own views and subjective
(personal) comments belong in the chapter conclusion/discussion.

Strive to present the results, for example measurement-, calculations- and/or
the simulation result, in a form that is as lucid and easily understandable as
possible. The results are preferably presented in diagrams or tables. Accounts
of interviews can be summarised, but may include concrete examples supporting
your work.

Extensive results, for example complete summaries of survey results, large
tables and long mathematical deductions, are placed in the appendices.
