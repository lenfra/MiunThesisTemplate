\section{\translate{Methodology}}\label{sec:method}
Summarize and introduce the methodology chapter. The method section is the point
at which your chosen method and intended procedure are presented. This section
should contain information for the reader to interpret your results and repeat
your work, i.e.\ in order to check the results. Here, the tools, assumptions,
mathematical models, performance measures and assessment criteria are presented.

\subsection{\translate{Scientific method description}}\label{subsec:scientificmethod}
Explain your scientific method. Quantitative method? Design science? Engineering research? etc. 

Explain how you will attack and work with each of the scientific/knowledge
goals/research questions. One paragraph per scientific goal/question is often
enough.

\subsection{\translate{Project method description}}\label{subsec:projectmethod}

Explain your project method. Split the work into a number of achievable milestones/phases. Many
theses work in computer engineering are typically split into the following parts: 
\emph{Theory} (in which you will gain more knowledge to be able to solve the problem),
\emph{Pre-study} (where you will further refine your requirements, approach, design, etc.),
\emph{Implementation} (where you will build some artifact), Measure (in which you will perform
measurements on your artifact), and \emph{Evaluation} (where you will analyze and evaluate your
results and measurements).  

Explain how you will work and do within each of these milestones/phases. Justify
your choice of methodology/model. What metrics will you use to evaluate your work? Comment on the
method's possible weaknesses and problems that may arise during actual implementation. A flowchart
can help in visualizing the work. One paragraph per milestone/phase is often enough to write.

\subsection{\translate{Project evaluation method}}\label{subsec:evalmethod}
How will you look back upon your whole thesis work in the end and evaluate if it
was a success? Focus on your whole thesis project process and remember that this
is different from your measurements/evaluation of your implementation.
