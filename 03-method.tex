\section{\translate{Methodology}}\label{sec:method}
Summarize and introduce the methodology chapter. The method section is the point
at which your chosen method and intended procedure are presented. This section
should contain information for the reader to interpret your results and repeat
your work, i.e.\ in order to check the results. Here, the tools, assumptions,
mathematical models, performance measures and assessment criteria are presented.

\subsection{\translate{Scientific method
  description}}\label{subsec:scientificmethod}
Explain your scientific method. Quantitative method? Etc.\ 

Explain how you will attack and work with each of the scientific/knowledge
goals/research questions. One paragraph per scientific goal/question is often
enough.

\subsection{\translate{Project method description}}\label{subsec:projectmethod}
Explain your project method. What are your milestones?
Split this hard work in this project into a number of achievable project
goals/milestones/phases. Explain how you will attack and work with each of
these project/implementation milestones. Justify your choice of
methodology/model. Comment on the method's possible weaknesses and problems that
may arise during actual implementation. One paragraph per milestone/phase is
often enough.

\subsection{\translate{Evaluation method}}\label{subsec:evalmethod}
How will you look back upon your whole thesis work in the end and evaluate if it
was a success? Focus on your whole thesis project process and remember that this
is different from your measurements/evaluation of your implementation.
